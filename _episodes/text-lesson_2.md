## How to write a study preregistration

Remember that a preregistration does not have to be perfect. Your preferred format and the amount of information included in the prereg will change as you get used to using them.
 
Use future tense to indicate that the study has not yet taken place. 

Make sure hypotheses are clearly labelled with numbers, prefixes or suffixes (e.g. H1, H2b, ws_H3a for workstream projects). This makes it clear how planned analyses link to specific hypotheses, which results relate to preregistered hypotheses and analyses, and which relate to unregistered hypotheses that weren't planned at the time of the preregistration.  

Make sure methods are specified with enough detail that a colleague with appropriate knowledge of the methods could replicate them. 

Consider inclusing contingencies or decision criteria for a range of outcomes, or if things go wrong. 


As a basic guide, methods may include:
>	- Sample size justification
>	- Exclusion/inclusion criteria and contingencies for when to stop or restart data collection
>	- How, exactly, will you measure your variables

Make sure analyses/ statistical tests are specified with enough detail to be replicated by someone with no knowledge of the study (e.g., not just ‘we will run a t-test,’ but specify how many tails, what type of t-test, inclusion criteria for sample)

It may help to simulate data and run analyses on it, to anticipate problems with the analysis plan.
Consider how null results will be treated and interpreted (e.g. equivalence testing)


## The above principles boil down to making sure:
The study you are preregistering is well-designed
The prereg is clearly written and linked to the later analysis and reporting
The prereg is specified in enough detail to allow replication
