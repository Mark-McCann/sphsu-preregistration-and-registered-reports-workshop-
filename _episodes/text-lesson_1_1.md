teaching: 15
exercises: 15
duration: null
summary: An introduction to what preregistration entails, the benefits of
  preregistration, and discussion of any concerns.
questions:
  - What is a preregistration?
  - What are the benefits of preregistration?
  - What concerns do people have about preregistration? How can we mitigate them?
objectives:
  - Understand what preregistration entails
  - Understand the benefits of preregistration
  - Understand common concerns and how to mitigate them
keypoints:
  - A preregistration is a specification of your research plan, written in
    advance on conducting the research
  - Preregistration benefits science and researchers by making your research
    more transparent
  - Researchers have several concerns surrounding preregistration, but many of
    them can be solved

## Introduction
It is important to the MRC that its funded units serve as exemplars of best practice regarding open science practices. Preregistration is an important aspect of open science practice, and is relatively straightforward for projects following SPHSU standard operating procedures to implement. 

Preregistration provides many benefits to the overall quality of scientific output by helping to reduce potential sources of bias at all stages of the research process, from study design through to publication. It also provides direct benefits to individual researchers, project teams, and the practical considerations of managing projects. 

Just like writing a dissertation or paper, or delivering a presentation, preregistration is a scientific practise. There will always be variation in practice across contexts. There is no 'perfect' preregistration, quality can and will vary, and your experience in preregistration will grow over time. 

## Benefits to science overall
> Preregistration helps to enhance science quality in several ways:
> - Reduces "P-hacking" or analysing data in different ways in order to find a "publishable" p-value.
> - Reduces hypothesising after results are known (HARKing) i.e. changing hypotheses to fit the findings.
> - Enhances replicability by ensuring protocols contain sufficient detail.
> - Enhances visibility of planned & in progress work. This prevents duplication and aids evidence synthesis.
> - Provides a clear time stamp for studies in specific domains or topics.

## Benefits to SPHSU and individual researchers

> Some of the benefits of preregistering your research include:
> - Improves credibility of the study findings with peer reviewers and readers.
> - Modifies project timelines. 
> - - More time invested at the protocol stage in design and analysis planning. 
> - - Time is saved at the analysis stage.
> - Keeps the study accountable to its original aims
> - Simplifies decisions around key papers & secondary papers


## Common concerns 

There are some common themes and issues related to preregistration. 

> ## Concern 1
> Preregistration isn't suited to exploratory analysis and prevents analysis based on emergent themes or trends in the data. 
> > ## Solution
> > Preregistration is a plan, not a prison. 
> > It is fine to incorporate preregistered analyses as well as post-hoc analyses, you just need to declare which is which.

> ## Concern 2
> What if I make a mistake or have an oversight?
> > ## Solution
> > Preregistration is about transparency, not inflexibility.
> > Changes to the preregistered plan are fine, they should be reported transparently
> > Guidance on how to register a change is available <a href="https://osf.io/yrvcg/" target="_blank">here</a> 


> ## Concern 3
> Is preregistration suitable for non-experimental research?
> > ## Solution
> > Preregistration is about open science, not experimental science. 
> > Preregistration involves transparently defining aims and methods beforehand, this can apply to all study designs. There are templates for many study designs, including <a href="https://osf.io/j7ghv/" target="_blank">Qualitative research  </a>  and <a href="https://osf.io/jqxfz/" target="_blank">Secondary data analysis </a>.


> ## Concern 4
> Preregistration creates extra work
> > ## Solution
> > Preregistration changes at what point in the research process some of the work takes place. The extra time invested at the start of a study saves time down the line. The wider benefits to the research team, and the wider scientific field justify the additional effort 

> ## Concern 5
> If I preregister my research my ideas and intellectual property might get scooped
> > ## Solution
> > Systematic reviews and clinical trials are regularly preregistered with no loss to the researchers.
> > For many studies, replication with other samples is desirable and should be encouraged.
> > Preregistrations can be embargoed until the study is complete. 
> > Embargoed preregistrations and any susequent modifications will retain their original time stamp.
